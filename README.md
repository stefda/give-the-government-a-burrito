City Pantry Front-End Coding Test
==========================

Your task is to implement a simple webpage to display a list of food packages that we can deliver to the Houses of Parliament in London. You are required to use `PackagesFactory.searchPackages` of the `citypantry-js-lib` library to access our API for the package search. The solution should meet at least the following requirements:

* The webpage has an input box to enter a desired type of food (e.g. "burritos", "burgers", etc.)
* The listed food packages get updated upon input change to match the desired food type

Guidelines:

* Install package dependencies
* Create a .gitignore file with any rules you feel would be appropriate
* Edit the file `your-code.js` to implement the required functionality
* Send the solution to david@citypantry.com either zipped in the email or as a link to your github repository with the solution

Structure the code as if this was a real, production application and state any assumptions you make as comments in the codebase. If any aspects of the above specification is unclear then please also state, as comments in the source, your interpretation of the requirement.

In evaluating your solution, we will pay particular attention to functionality, code structure and clarity of implementation, but also aesthetics of the user interface.

Happy coding!
