City Pantry Front-End Coding Test
==========================

Your task is to implement a simple webpage to display a list of food packages that we can deliver to the Houses of Parliament in London. You are required to use `PackagesFactory.searchPackages` of the `citypantry-js-lib` library to access our API for package search. The page should have at least the following:

* An input box to enter type of food (e.g. "burritos", "burgers", etc.)
* A dynamic list of food packages matching the entered food type

Guidelines:

* Install package dependencies
* Create a .gitignore file with any rules you feel would be appropriate
* Edit the file `your-code.js` to implement the required functionality
* Send the solution to david@citypantry.com either zipped in an email or as a link to a github repository with the solution

Structure the code as if this was a real, production application and state any assumptions you make as comments in the codebase. If any aspects of the above specification is unclear then please also state, as comments in the source, your interpretation of the requirement.
